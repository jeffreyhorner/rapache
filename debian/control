Description: Apache module for running server-side R programs
 This package provides the R module for the Apache 2 webserver. Note
 that it will work with either Apache's prefork or worker MPM. Prefork
 is preferred.  
 .
 R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
 By embedding R inside Apache, developers can create dynamic web pages and
 graphics.  Even more compelling is the ability for developers to provide
 web service style access to novel, cutting edge statistical techniques.
